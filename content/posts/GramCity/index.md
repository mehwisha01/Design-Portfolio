## Description

This was one of the fun consulting project as a UX designer. The approach was to take the design sprint approach for user onboarding.

### Background

Our app offers you great recommendations/suggestions based on your current location . This is a peer-to-peer network based system so be sure to upload your photos so others can also journey with you.

## Day 1: Map

![Day 1: Map](/Map.png)

Team:

<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li>Product Owner - 1</li>
  <li>Business Analyst - 1</li>
  <li>Client Services - 3</li>
  <li>Developer- 2</li>
  <li>UX Designer- 2</li>
  <li>Scrum Master- 1</li>
  <li>QA- 1 </li>
</ul>

I wanted to achieve a better version of the product by the end of five day sprint. As always, it was important for me to have all stakeholders drive the final design of the product without my bias.

### User Empathy

Since I had invited the Client Services, UX Designers and Product owners as our stakeholders, it became a lot easier to think as a user. We used our Quantitative and Qualitative data to see the problem space and talk as a customer with all stakeholder.

### Personas

User 1: Nick
Goal: Nick wants ro find great places to take photos to document his trips, but doesnt want to spend time researching or traveling out of the way to find them.

User 2: Sarah
Goal: Sarah wants to easily find locations and the example of the best photo ops in a city before planning out her day around visiting them.

### How Might We (HMW)

As we brainstormed some of the questions along with 5 Why's exercise, we were sure to build a different perspective.

<ol>
<li>How might we have users to pin their places that can be shared with others?</li>
<li>How might we have users to share their location to make a suggestion?</li>
<li>How might we know users’ interests/preferences for locations?</li>
<li>How might we keep users secured in the process?</li>
<li>How might we suggest awesome places by rating?</li>
</ol>

### Map: How users move through product and services.

This was a quick mapping exercise done on the whiteboard without creating extensive workflows.

Account -> Preferences -> Location/Vicinity ->Stars ->Pics/Description -> Upload/Download a photo

Account -> Geo-location Enabled ->Suggestions/Recommendations/Personalization -> Pics/description -> upload a photo

Account -> Location/Vicinity -> Add a place -> Upload a photo/description -> Share

### Day 1: Closeout

We had achieved a lot during this day so we wrapped up with taking a group photo and ending with inspirational quotes.

## Day 2: Sketch

Here we are finally showing off our sketching skills to eachother.

### Lightening Demos

Having product background, Vision, Mission, Competitive Analysis and Tech analysis is really important so each stakeholder was given 15 minutes to warm up and present what they knew about our product and checkout the competitors so we have a different perspective.

Here is a little analysis on that:

Flickr- Platform where you can get inspiration from others by following them also by choosing Trending pictures. Very rich design that even gives you the camera specs, map and time.

Loaded Landscapes: Informational site that places all best photographic sceneries in one place. User have to click on a link and create a list of places to experience.

### Crazy 8s

This was definitely crazy to just freely start sketching whatever comes to mind. For this particular exercise, I had to picture myself at any place which I was visiting to recommend to my friend.
Here is me going too crazy with this exercise, not the cutest sketches you have seen :)

### Pick a Target : One specific map?

Account -> Geo-location Enabled ->Suggestions/Recommendations/Personalization ->Pics description/Star ratings-> Add location to your trip-> upload/share a photo

![Targeted Map ](/wf.png)

We had several routes that we could’ve taken. From preferences, we wanted to personalize the user experience. During user on-boarding, we will ask questions that will drive the recommendations, however, our main focus is to give users ability to see the places and upload their pics/videos. Users may disable sharing from privacy settings or have the images shared globally with others.
There was a lot of thinking around privatization and recommendations, therefore, this design was a better solution.

## Day 3: Decide & Storyboard

We were on Day 3 and we needed inspirations and decide on what needs to be prioritize and others to be worked on next sprints.

![Day 3: Decide ](/decide.png)

Usually my search consists of Pinterest UIs for inspirations to build out storyboards.

Also created my Inspirational board to get the color Palette and actually expand on moodboard.

## Day 4: Prototype

While going through the notes that my incredible UXers have put together, we created prototypes. This was the final result:

## Day 5: Test

Participants were chosen on two criterias: Travelers and App users. They were all working professionals who are a mixture of personas identified.

### Test Results

User 1: “Overall, I liked the color palette and the suggestions screen”. She was severely disrupted by Covid 19 closures and would like for the app to push notifications regarding closures or modified schedules of places. Something that can be added on to the next sprint.
User 2: “I don't like too many colors in the app and would like to see an inspirational screen where I can add pictures and ops so I can take my own pictures “. This feature is not linked to any screen, however, clicking on your profile picture takes you to picture collages.
User 3: “Amazing colors, just not too easy on the eyes”. App does the job of addressing the users needs but would like to see an extended version to see E2E.
User 4: “I like the app but is there a way I can turn off location and Notifications services. I don't like to get too many notifications from any apps”. The app does do the job of suggesting the sites and the distance if the user wants to pursue the ops area.
User 5: “Great App, I want to be able to share the pictures from collages and what about the video uploads?”.

## Lessons Learned : Sum it All Up

At the end of day 5, users got the context of one feature path of the app, however, this path requires users to see the E2E process. Overall, feedback was great and new features like, video uploads, live feeds can be added in the next iteration.
