## Description

As a UX Design consultant, I was tasked with redesigning the site to make it look more futuristic yet easy to use for new users.

### Competitive Analysis

I started off with doing a Competitive Analysis of all ML platforms and here were some of the findings:

   <table style="width:100%">
     <tr>
     <th></th>
     <th><a href="https://www.datarobot.com/platform/automated-machine-learning/"> Data Robot </a> </th>
     <th><a href = "https://www.gainsight.com"> Gainsight </a></th>
     <th><a href= "https://www.gainsight.com"> BigML </a></th>
     <th><a href="https://www.h2o.ai"> H2O </a></th>
     <th><a href= "https://eazyml.com"> EazyML </a></th>
   </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Strengths</td>
     <td>Webinars, resources and very rich ML Platform.</td>
     <td>Has ML solutions resources and is more than ML Platform.</td>
     <td>Video training and very rich documents. The best teaching materials.</td>
     <td>Short Trial:- necessary to learn the platform.</td>
     <td>Portal with free signup. Good Product onboarding walkthrough. </td>
    </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Weakness</td>
     <td>Demos- no other way of using the platform.</td>
     <td>Have to set up the demo to see the portal, no other way of learning as this is ML isnt the only solution offered on their site.</td>
     <td>Limited data space to run bigger models.</td>
     <td>Not available to all who want to have a dry run.</td>
     <td>UI is very outdated. Product onboarding walkthrough will also need redesigning. </td>
   </tr>

(....) many more screens to get to graphical representation.
<br>I reduced the number of clicks which was causing users to be lost on steps.<br>

<b>New Design</b>

### Testing Results

I tested the prototypes with several users who had positive feedback on how easy the new design was to get to the analysis. Everyone loved the search feature and buttons (add or remove outliers). The new design increased the ROI by 78% as there is still little more work left on the entire website redesign E2E.

### Lessons Learned

When I was consulted for re-design, no documentations were given to me. I had to reverse engineer from the portal. I have made following recommendations for company to be successful:

<ul><li> Documentations - Keep up with the docs as features are prioritized to understand the users' needs.</li>
<li> Data flows - These are very important as some screens weren't really needed. </li>
<li> Test with the end users more often since the feedback from users is very valuable. </li></ul>
