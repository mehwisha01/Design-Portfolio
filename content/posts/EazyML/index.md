## Description

As a UX Design consultant, I was tasked with User Research to take User Centric approach to design.

### Competitive Analysis

I started off with doing a Competitive Analysis of all ML Platforms and here were some of the findings:

   <table style="width:100%">
     <tr>
     <th></th>
     <th><a href="https://www.datarobot.com/platform/automated-machine-learning/"> Data Robot </a> </th>
     <th><a href = "https://www.gainsight.com"> Gainsight </a></th>
     <th><a href= "https://www.gainsight.com"> BigML </a></th>
     <th><a href="https://www.h2o.ai"> H2O </a></th>
     <th><a href= "https://eazyml.com"> EazyML </a></th>
   </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Strengths</td>
     <td>Webinars, resources and very rich ML Platform.</td>
     <td>Has ML solutions resources and is more than ML Platform.</td>
     <td>Video training and very rich documents. The best teaching materials.</td>
     <td>Short Trial:- necessary to learn the platform.</td>
     <td>Portal with free signup. Good Product onboarding walkthrough. </td>
    </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Weakness</td>
     <td>Demos- no other way of using the platform.</td>
     <td>Have to set up the demo to see the portal, no other way of learning as this is ML isnt the only solution offered on their site.</td>
     <td>Limited data space to run bigger models.</td>
     <td>Not available to all who want to have a dry run.</td>
     <td>UI is very outdated. Product onboarding walkthrough will also need redesigning. </td>

<b>Age: </b> <br>18-28 yrs old </br>
<b>Location:</b> <br>Online </br>

<b>Motivations:</b>
<br>See data prediction and accuracy of models.</br>

<b>Pain Points:</b>

<ul><li>Tables are sophisticated to understand and interpret. </li>

</ul>

<b>Core Needs:</b>

<ul>

<li>See data in a better tabular format.</li>
</ul>

### Quantitative/Qualitative Research

Following measurements were utilized along with interviewing the users:

<ul>
<li> Pageviews : To find out which pages were viewed by each user. We ranked the pages based on this. </li>
<li> Latency : The amount of time it took to upload and get the possible solutions to their data. </li>
<li> Goals: Were user able to get the quick solution without knowing much about Machine Learning. </li>

This data helped with recruiting the users for interviews to find out more.

I created user flows to help development team to optimize the number of clicks. We conducted usability testing with the users and find more process improvement before launching the newly built design.

### Outcomes

The research was handed over to the team to do the quick wireframing and prototyping. With Research, we gained a good feedback which influenced the re-design of the portal. Usability Testing was incorporated at each step and added to Design Strategy.
