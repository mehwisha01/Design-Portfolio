## Description

As a UX Design consultant, I was tasked with redesigning the site to make it look more futuristic yet easy to use for new users.

### Competitive Analysis

I started off with doing a Competitive Analysis of all ML platforms and here were some of the findings:

   <table style="width:100%">
     <tr>
     <th></th>
     <th><a href="https://www.datarobot.com/platform/automated-machine-learning/"> Data Robot </a> </th>
     <th><a href = "https://www.gainsight.com"> Gainsight </a></th>
     <th><a href= "https://www.gainsight.com"> BigML </a></th>
     <th><a href="https://www.h2o.ai"> H2O </a></th>
     <th><a href= "https://eazyml.com"> EazyML </a></th>
   </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Strengths</td>
     <td>Webinars, resources and very rich ML Platform.</td>
     <td>Has ML solutions resources and is more than ML Platform.</td>
     <td>Video training and very rich documents. The best teaching materials.</td>
     <td>Short Trial:- necessary to learn the platform.</td>
     <td>Portal with free signup. Good Product onboarding walkthrough. </td>
    </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Weakness</td>
     <td>Demos- no other way of using the platform.</td>
     <td>Have to set up the demo to see the portal, no other way of learning as this is ML isnt the only solution offered on their site.</td>
     <td>Limited data space to run bigger models.</td>
     <td>Not available to all who want to have a dry run.</td>
     <td>UI is very outdated. Product onboarding walkthrough will also need redesigning. </td>

### Quantitative/Qualitative Research

Following measurements were utilized along with interviewing the users:

<ul>
<li> Pageviews : To find out which pages were viewed by each user. We ranked the pages based on this. </li>
<li> Latency : The amount of time it took to upload and get the possible solutions to their data. </li>
<li> Goals: Were user able to get the quick solution without knowing much about Machine Learning. </li>

This data helped recruit the users to interview and find out more about them.

I created user flows to help development team to optimize the number of clicks. We conducted usability testing with the users and find more process improvement before launching the newly built design.
