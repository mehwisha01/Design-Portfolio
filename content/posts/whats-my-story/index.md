The main goal of this post is to give you a short intro about myself. It should serve as an informal catch-up with those of you, who don't know me that well yet üôÇ.

Hopefully, this will give you a better understanding of the content I am going to put out and the ideas I am going to express.

## The present in a¬†nutshell

My brain has been exploding with innovating ideas every once in a while, due to me questioning the technology's impact on us and our environment.

Currently, I am launching PackOwnBox as a product which will change online package deliveries. Each product delievered whether in a cardboard box and plastic or perforated bags has an impact.

I have been involved with some of the best teams in the world and have worked with Startups and Big Tech giants. It has been a great journey to hold different job titles which has given me an advantage over many of my peers.

I am trying to cut back on my habit of working long hours so I am not tied to my desk, car or closet. I do **travel** a lot and would love to **work\*\***remotely\*\* because traveling and meeting different people open up your mind to user empathy. Learning different cultures and their setting is extremely important when designing at a global scale.

## How did I get to this¬†point?

I am from NYC (lived right by the Times Square) and currently residing in Ocean View, DE (Rehoboth, Dewey and Bethany Beach). Its a Summer town, however, ocean never stops.

At T.S, those who have been to the area would understand how powerful that place is for designers. Multi Culture, languages and tourists from all over the world add so much more to the perspective. The place is full with Entertainment, Design Inspirations and going beyond Globalization and localization. I felt fortunate to find all types of people at one place.

While switching my career and job, I learned about different users, needs and domains. I loved observing how one department interacted with the application versus the others. Once internal business functions were understood, I expanded my research into the end users and their interactions. It was mind-blowing to find out that internal users were not trained well on the new features of the application. This help me conclude that perhaps silos approach needs to be broken and we should have users available from all LOB. I also found that just having team managers didnt contribute much to the product but also adding team members added more value.

Fast forward I am not just a strategist, developer, QA or PO, I am also a user of many products. I have built a habit of researching my topics well and testing products with the real users have contributed to making me a strong UX Designer. As I continue my journey, there is a lot to learn and grow into this field. I am currently building my own product "PackOwnBox" which has embedded user empathy to its core, however, very open to a good opportunity that comes my way.

## What about my free¬†time?

I like to choose activities which helps me gain a new perspective. I try to refrain from things which drain my energy, make me feel bad or does not align with my long term vision. I fail at this sometimes though, but I am trying my best.

I really enjoy reading, usually non-fiction, for example. If a book catches my attention, I will put it on my list, no matter the topic. However, my favorites are about psychology, business, self-improvement, coding, tech based and design. I like to read only one book at a time and learn about the given topic from a couple of different sources.

I also have a passion for traveling and taking pictures. I dont like to carry too much of equipments but definitely my wide angeled, fisheye and a cell phone. I love capturing pictures of places, people , cultural events, food and local markets.

Searching for new destinations to explore. Once I've got bitten by the travel bug, it is hard to go back. I keep finding myself on Skyscanner checking out flights, on Airbnb planning the next trip or just trying to find the best itinerary for a future adventure all the time.

Taking it easy. This can be anything from meeting up with friends, taking a long walk, reflecting back on life or just enjoying the [JOMO](https://bit.ly/2zGxHPr).
