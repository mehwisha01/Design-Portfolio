## Back Story

While creating my content, I came across this video and realized the very planet we all call home is threatened by us. While playing the video, multitasking at the time, I placed an order online. I looked for options from one store to another if I can actually make better choices with delivery methods and materials (issue for me to tie up boxes and recycle).

And then finally the packages arrived. As I started opening the boxes, unusually large box with a tiny dress came filled with papers- presumably protecting sides and wrapped in a plastic bag. As always crunched with time and lazy to recycle, I left the other boxes stored in my apartment for next few days.

And finally, I realized, there has to be more choices given to consumers for delivery boxes, sizes and methods. We have to raise more awareness with the impact this waste is causing.

### My Role

Founder and CEO - Product UX Designer

### Problem Statement

In 2016, it cost New York City \$18 per ton or more to collect and process recyclables. Yet, companies are still delivering packages in bigger than product's size boxes adding additonal waste. In 2020, we want consumer to have sustainable delivery options.

### Description

Since Packages ordered through online retailers are creating an additional waste, I would like to explore this opportunity to have Eco-Friendly shipping materials and methods while showing consumer the order index impact by making sustainable choices. Consumers will be able to pack their own packages to reduce the waste impact.

Here is a glimpse of the impact index that will display at the end of each order.

### Reserach

![Profiling](/Research-1.png)

Many consumers and companies alike are trying to claim sustainability status, however, less importance is given to how packages materials is contributing to the waste. There isnt a central repository on the impact of the materials and sizes of delivery method.

## User Screeners/Interviews

Design process to vet out the users with the help of screeners and interview was conducted. From all of the users interviews, following insights were derived:
“Eco-Friendliness is really important and I shop at those stores who are trying to make a difference.” When asked about the shipment materials, “There is no choice and many stores use perforated materials that may take longer to decompose”. When asked about the last shopping experience, “Bought items through Macy's and Amazon, packages came in with small items in a big box with so much waste materials“ “Stores can also save money if they use dimensions properly for packing goods.”

### Empathy Maps

This was a crucial state as interviews depicted Eco-friendliness as a choice not every interviewee felt strong about the sustainable options. Two empathy maps were built with two groups:
Working Professional:

Student/Part-time Worker:

### Persona

I identified two persona groups:

Students who are busy studying and need items shipped out or being available within a short period of time.

Working Professionals who have very less time at their hands while juggling home and office responsibilities.

### How Might We (HMW)

I wanted to broaden the and explore my thoughts with the users who were shaping the whole project along with me. Following are the few questions that shaped the research process:

- How might we broaden the delivery options for people during online checkouts?
- How might we solve the delivery cost for customers?
- How might we help consumers make eco-friendly choices?
- How might we help reduce the environmental waste caused by shipping materials?

### Affinity Diagram

Users were invited to the brainstorming exercise to validate and shape our research results. Below is a depiction of the workshop:

### Early Sketches

Early interactive sketches with test Results

Usability Test Results:
"Please remove Information as I am not sure if its a user information?"
"How do I pack my own box, what will be the interface?"
"Wow, this is great to see the product in action, how the system will prompt me of the price change?"

### Wireframes

After the sketches, I put together detailed wireframes of the red routes so I can test more with users while perfecting the solution.

### Moodboard and User Flows

While testing wireframes and looking for inspiration, I created the Moodboard.

I moved forward to build the user flows of Critical Paths for the application.

### Prototype

Once the mood was set, it was time to build out the Hi-fi prototype which was tested thoroughly in iterations and after fixes, tested again.

### New Features Requests

Concluding the design and handing the prototypes to development team is not the end rather the beginning as I am currently overseeing new features through the feedback loop. Below are some of the great features requested by users in product backlog:

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
         <li>Add the impact on Pickup Orders.</li>
         <li>Show some how-to videos for AR packaging so consumer know how to utilize maximum space.</li>
         <li>Even if AR devices are not available, user should roughly see how the packages will be packed.</li>
