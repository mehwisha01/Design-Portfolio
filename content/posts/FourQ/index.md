## My Role

Lead Product Designer
E2E User Experience/ Customer Experience
B2B and B2C

## Description

FourQ is the only full-service, complete solution for automating intercompany billing and invoice management for multinational organizations and their suppliers. We employ industry-leading expertise to improve shared service productivity while reducing global tax and compliance exposure. We specialize in B2B and B2C Software suite.

## Background

As a lead product designer, I am involved with designing multiple products under one platform umbrella and redesign the old product to maximize the ROI and build KPIs to measure the success of new UX. As a startup, we missed the crucial and important component which was using User Centric Approach to design the system. I began with monitoring and analyzing the sales and marketing data and Helpdesk tickets filled with user challenges with our UI and multiple clicks as the interbilling is a complex system. There were challenges with our current system as the UI was outdated and was built with few clients/user base in mind.With new design and better UX, we are trying to maximize the usability of our products and gain new clients.

## User Research

After carefully analyzing the logs and helpdesk data, I started forming my hypothesis on whether the redesign or building more product lines will be a viable solution. I began forming surveys to see CSAT with our current offering and started qualifying the endusers in billing/fintech industry with screeners. Thorough interviews were conducted to understand the users' mental models. As a UX Practice, empathy maps and personas were shaped to understand users feelings, needs, wants and goals. Both moderated and unmoderated interviews were conducted to solidify which persona group can be tackeled first. It was imperative for our business to understand our users and build the product that user will not only use but also recommend to other users.
To summarize user research based on user feedback was to improve UX/UI and build new products so there could be one E2E solution. Users dont want to use multiple products to do billing on one and invoicing & payments on the other.

## Persona

After interviewing at least 10 participants, our persona groups started taking form. This was the hardest step as we had many users with different needs and wants. Empathy maps helped us tremendously to group many users with similar goals under the same persona. I further categorized Persona groups in to two Categories:

#### Primary

This Category consists of those users who deal with application on the daily basis for everyday tasks.

#### Secondary

This Category consists of those users who deal with application from IT levels to Compliance level and may not interact with the application on daily basis.

## Empathy Maps/Wireframes

Empathy maps were created to give the team into more insights on what user feel, do, say and want. Persona did bring our team to understand the users but empathy mapping helped us to be in user's shoes. Once I felt that we understand our users enough, I started sketching out the wireframe of the old product and new product. These wireframe were tested with many sets of different users within persona group.

Few Examples of the wireframe that was tested with the real users for additional feedback and adjusted.

## User Feedback

Following is a list of just few feedback/insights I received from the users:

User 1: <i>I should be able to see the historical data so that if I am responsible on missing a payment, I can find the discrepancy or pay the vendor out immediately. </i>

User 2: <i>I would like to see the tooltip or info on the status such as cancelled, rejected and disputed. The system should highlight such invoices visually.</i>

User 3: <i>I like the upload drop zone as it makes the drag and drop action easier for me. I want to see the percentage of upload completed as I may have other tasks at hand and see how far I am in the process.</i>

User 4: <i>I have to click into multiple areas to just find out the discrepancies for adjustments. The system looks so old and there are many better sites I have used that have much better UX. For instance, just for billing, I have to figure out the routes and see which rules should be applicable to me as I am looking into international invoices.</i>

User 4: <i> The system does do what it is intended to but I hate the fact that I am doing billing in one system and invoicing and payment in another. Can't I just be able to transfer data and setup like recurring billing or so? </i>

There was lots of feedback in terms of adding additional features and I was happy to adjust design accordingly.

## Prototyping

These prototypes were created and tested by different set of users while incorporating their feedback in the next iteration. Due to legal concers, full prototypes are not shared on these Figma links.

## Journey Mapping

With journey mapping, I was able to see the user flow and how we can create a brand with user loyalty.

## Usability Testing

I have utilized many Observation techniques (sitting with the clients' on their workplace to gather performance related data as well as observing their daily operation). I have ran both moderated and unmoderated tests with written scenarios and scripts to understand how succesful and easy the design would be if we proceed with development.
Card sorting with optimal sort(online tool) was also conducted to create a robust Information Architectue.

## Conclusion

I have seen the benefits from both Qualitative(from user interviews to running Usability testing sessions) and Quantitative data(Analytics)to create worldclass User Experiences within Products. Rich data in a form of Users feedsback has helped us increase our ROI by 58% and this number is projected to ascend. Being a design lead, I have measured the success of our products and also understand our users' needs to increase our user retention rates.

Although I have kept my narrative at the bare minimum here as I am still building different parts of the solution, please feel free to contact me should you want to learn more.
