## My Role

Lead Product Designer
E2E User Experience/ Customer Experience

## Description

FourQ is the only full-service, complete solution for automating intercompany billing and invoice management for multinational organizations and their suppliers. We employ industry-leading expertise to improve shared service productivity while reducing global tax and compliance exposure. We specialize in B2B and B2C Software suite.

## Background

As a lead product designer, I am involved with designing multiple products under one platform umbrella and redesign the old product to maximize the ROI and build KPIs to measure the success of new UX. As a startup, we missed the crucial and important component which was using User Centric Approach to design the system. I began with monitoring and analyzing the sales and marketing data and Helpdesk tickets filled with user challenges with our UI and multiple clicks as the interbilling is a complex system. There were challenges with our current system as the UI was outdated and was built with few clients/user base in mind.With new design and better UX, we are trying to maximize the usability of our products and gain new clients.

## User Research

After carefully analyzing the logs and helpdesk data, I started forming my hypothesis on whether the redesign or building more product lines will be a viable solution. I began forming surveys to see CSAT with our current offering and started qualifying the user's based on persona- mentioned below. Based on persona, I took a hybrid approach of having few focus group sessions and individual user interviews including current and prospective users. The interview wasn't only design on the current UI issues but also on future enhancements. This helped understanding the user needs to build a better product.

To summarize user research based on user feedback was to improve UX/UI and build new products so there could be one E2E solution. Users dont want to use multiple products to do billing on one and invoicing & payments on the other.

## Persona

I categorized Persona groups in to two Categories

#### Primary

This Category consists of those users who deal with application on the daily basis for everyday tasks.

#### Secondary

This Category consists of those users who deal with application from IT levels to Compliance level and may not interact with the application on daily basis.

## Empathy Maps Wireframes

Empathy maps were created to give the team into more insights on what user feel, do, say and want. Persona did bring our team to understand the users but empathy mapping helped us to be in user's shoes. Once I felt that we understand our users enough, I started sketching out the wireframe of the old product and new product. These wireframe were tested with many sets of different users within persona group.

Few Examples of the wireframes that was tested with the real users for additional feedback and adjusted.

## User Feedback

Following is a list of just few feedback received from the users:

User 1: <i>I should be able to see the historical data so that if I am responsible on missing a payment, I can find the discrepancy or pay the vendor out immediately. </i>

User 2: <i>I would like to see the tooltip or info on the status such as cancelled, rejected and disputed. The system should highlight such invoices visually.</i>

User 3: <i>I like the upload drop zone as it makes the drag and drop action easier for me. I want to see the percentage of upload completed as I may have other tasks at hand and see how far I am in the process.</i>

User 4: <i>I have to click into multiple areas to just find out the discrepancies for adjustments. The system looks so old and there are many better sites I have used that have much better UX. For instance, just for billing, I have to figure out the routes and see which rules should be applicable to me as I am looking into international invoices.</i>

User 4: <i> The system does do what it is intended to but I hate the fact that I am doing billing in one system and invoicing and payment in another. Can't I just be able to transfer data and setup like recurring billing or so? </i>

There was lots of feedback in terms of adding additional features and I was happy to adjust design accordingly.

## Prototyping

Prototypes were absolutely crucial to our user experience as users including stakeholders were able to get their hands on interaction and the proces flow. These prototypes are just a glimpse into the system and may help new designers to see what the hi-fi prototypes should look like and be acceptible by users and all stakeholders.

## Journey Mapping

With journey mapping, I was able to see the user flow and how we can create a brand with user loyalty.

## Usability Testing

Although I got to test the wireframe thoroughly, as prototypes are built out, I am constantly testing them with users before developer's handoff. After all, users feedback is vital as we want to build a better usable product or line of products.

## Conclusion

I am currently implementing Analytics to get some quantitative feedback from the user data. I kept the UX at the Qualitative level to understand users better so that my design startegy doesn't miss out on the key and important "User" component. With some improvements made to the UX and UI, we are able to attract many more businesses to use our solution.

Although I have kept my narrative at the bare minimum here as I am still building different parts of the solution, pleasse feel free to check back for more or check out my other work.
