## My Role

Lead Product Designer
E2E User Experience/ Customer Experience

## Description

FourQ is the only full-service, complete solution for automating intercompany billing and invoice management for multinational organizations and their suppliers. We employ industry-leading expertise to improve shared service productivity while reducing global tax and compliance exposure. We specialize in B2B and B2C Software suite.

## Background

As a product designer, I am involved with multiple products. OneBiller is an exixting product with outdated UI and UX, whereas, PayMaster is a new product line. I wasn't part of the user research, however, I am building out Persona from User Profiles. I am also involved in Wireframing, Analytics and Heatmapping (Understanding user's behavior) and User Testing.

## User Research

Although not fully involved in user research as I joined the team after this was conducted, Design reflects the insights gathered from the users.

## Persona

We categorized Persona in two Categories

#### Primary

This Category consists of those users who deal with application on the daily basis for everyday tasks.

#### Secondary

This Category consists of those users who deal with application from IT levels to Compliance level.

## Moodboard and Wireframes

After Persona building, with the emphasis on user empathy(HCD), I build out the moodboard. Translating the moodboard into wireframes wasn't a hard task as the research guided me on the User needs and wants(Empathy Mapping).
Few Examples of the wireframes that was tested with the real users for additional feedback and adjusted.

## User Feedback

User 1: <i>I should be able to see the History with the file that I uploaded so that I can see it was the correct file I uploaded. </i>

User 2: <i>I would like to see the tooltip or info on the status such as cancelled, rejected and disputed. The system should highlight such invoices visually.</i>

User 3: <i>I like the upload drop zone as it makes the drag and drop action easier for me. I want to see the percentage of upload completed as I may have other tasks at hand and see how far I am in the process.</i>

There was lots of feedback in terms of adding additional features and I was happy to adjust design accordingly.

## Prototyping

Prototypes were absolutely crucial to our user experience as users including stakeholders were able to get their hands on interaction and the proces flow.

## User Testing

I am currently recruiting users to conduct user testing of the prototypes to pass the vetted design to our development team.

## Conclusion

I have narrowly touched on the Customer Experience as I am designing one platform for multiple product lines. This is still under construction so tune in for more.
