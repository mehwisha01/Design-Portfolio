### **_ Note to Readers- This page will be updated as I make progress in increasing the visibilty of Careers site _**

## Problem Statement

ATF(Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms) is a Government Agency trying to attract more BIPOC especially women to apply for Special Agents, Investigators and other professional jobs to diversify its workplace and culture. ATF wants to be inclusive to all races, cultures and religion.

Want to <a href="https://www.atf.gov/careers"> learn more...</a>

## Description

My Role is a Part Time <b>Senior UX Architect.</b>

I was hired after several interviews were conducted by another team. After watching some of the interviews during User Research, I identified the gap on missing the interviews on the User Job Experience with ATF. Therefore, I conducted my own User Interviews of the recent hires.

My duties includes User Research, Empathy Mapping, Persona/Profile building, Content Strategy, Information Architecture , Wireframing, Prototyping and User Testing

### Background

ATF being a Government Agency doesnt have a great reputation. Since majority of the special Agents are white male (tension with BLM Movements) and is underrepresnted by the Male/Female BIPOC and other Minority groups.
The issue is two fold, first the reputation (Re-branding) followed by the underrepresentation of minority groups.

## Information Architecture

Before contributing further into the project, I wanted to see how the information Architecture is perceived at the current site. Since ATF site is full of so much information, checking the flow was a necessity.

IA table with Taxonomy <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NyfovFWwte2TSepiyUgaRW39Pir8ph2P22ehgW6ihPQ/edit?usp=sharing">

<b> Findings</b> I found many pages were either not updated and didn't follow the proper Taxonomy. There was Repitition and we can make IA much simpler.

Card Sorting - Schedule - TBD

### User Interviews

I am currently conducting interviews with the recent hired candidates to find their recruitment and hiring process experience.

<b> Key Insights </b>

<ol> 
<li>The application process takes too long </li>
<li> There is too much information to read on career pages </li>
<li> Very little mention on Diversity and Culture </li>
<li> Missing the journey of recent hire or what the job looks like daily - user prefer to watch videos rather than reading </li>
