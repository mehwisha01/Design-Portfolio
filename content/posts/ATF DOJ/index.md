## Problem Statement

ATF(Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms) is a Government Agency trying to attract more BIPOC especially women to apply for Special Agents, Investigators and other professional jobs to diversify its workplace and culture. ATF wants to be inclusive to all races, cultures and religion.

## Description

My Role is a Part Time <b>Senior UX Architect.</b>

I was hired after several interviews were conducted by another team. After watching some of the interviews during User Research, I identified the gap on missing the interviews on the User Job Experience with ATF. Therefore, I conducted my own User Interviews of the recent hires.

My duties includes User Research, Empathy Mapping, Persona/Profile building, Content Strategy, Information Architecture , Wireframing, Prototyping and User Testing

### Background

ATF being a Government Agency doesnt have a great reputation. Since majority of the special Agents are white male (tension with BLM Movements) and is underrepresnted by the Male/Female BIPOC and other Minority groups.
The issue is two fold, first the reputation (Re-branding) followed by the underrepresentation of minority groups.

## Information Architecture

Before contributing further into the project, I wanted to see how the information Architecture is perceived at the current site. Since ATF site is full of so much information, checking the flow was a necessity.

<b> Findings</b>

I found many pages were either not updated and didn't follow the proper Taxonomy. There were repititive and broken links found, therefore, less Engagement from Users.

Card Sorting - Schedule - TBD

### Empathy Maps

There are 5 Personas identified but due to NDA, I am only allowed to give a glimpse of one of the Empathy Map.
