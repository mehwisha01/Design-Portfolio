## Design Consulting

Given the extensive profile of clientele, TCS selects the expert Designer consultant to join the design team for its client. We are a team of UX experts with the focus on E2E Design process. We facilitate design workshops, develop prototypes, develop usability testing, heuristic analysis and all that design has to offer.

## Description

Being a design expert, I have had an opprtunity to work with many great design teams from financial to manufacturing. Due to NDA, I have kept all designs high-level to give background about the project and the finished product. Below is the description of few projects and my role:

<ol>
<li>PNC (Apr 2022 to Feb 2023), Lead Designer for Offers for WBA and Web </li>
<li>DTCC (March 2023 to Dec 2023), Lead UX Designer </li>
<li>Clarios (Jan 2024 to March 2024)</li>
<li>Stellantis (Apr 2024 to Current)</li>
</ol>

### Projects Background

At PNC, I designed the pre-selected offers interface for web and banking application customers. Pre-selected offers were outdated and weren't represented on the web as the mailers were mailed out to the customers. I led stakeholders workshops while designing the solution and validated the designs with the end users. The design tool utilized was sketch and Invision. PNC has a mature Design system (DSM) which houses many components to be reused for consistency purposes, however, offers required out of the box thinking to make offers interesting enough for users.

DTCC(DTCC50) was a rebranding project. Style guide and designs needed to be updated with adding more components to the guide. As the lead on the project, I worked with senior and junior designers. Tool used was XD and later designs were converted to Figma. We introduced new components like file upload, notifications (toaster and page level notifications), Navigation and notifications.

Clarios is a battery manufacturing plant. I have designed for the Operator persona. This persona has many operator roles(stack, cos, mentor, belt). There was no centralized system that operators could refer to. Old school (paper, calls, emails, etc) was used for communicating. While conducting user interviews with the operators, it was clear that other than paper based/white board and calls, operators never used the computers that were attached to each line. I started designs with user data from the ground up and the end product was designed to have e2e design system that works for operators so they can manufacture high quality product.

Stellantis is a well known European car manufacturer who has acquired US Dodge/Chrysler car industry. The project is to design a dealership experience for both Global and North America dealers. This is an ongoing project and will be updated when design is completed.
