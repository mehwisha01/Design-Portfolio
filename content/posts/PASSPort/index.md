## Role

As an Assistant Director of Product, Design and QA, I designed, Researched and held IDEO workshops. As a result, ROI was increased by 78%.

## Description

For the last 2 years, I have been designing several different complex workflows and UX design for the City of New York, Mayor’s Office of Contract Services. This portal is known as PASSPort(Procurement and Services Solutions Portal). This solution is similar to Amazon marketplace where Sellers(Vendors) and Buyer(Agencies) conduct their business based on valid contracts and budget.

### Research and Ideation

I ran several design workshops to discuss the requirements and do usability testing of the prototypes with all stakeholders of city agencies.The day started with some background on the Portal and the solutions it provides followed by the demo of the system.

### Workflows

Based on my research of the topic, I designed the part of the workflows/Persona so this can be expanded based on different agencies’ needs.

For this discussion to take place, I had users break out in a group based on their industry(Standard/Professional Services, Construction, etc.). Each designer led a single group along with note takers.

We captured requirements as the users spoke about their own agencies’ functions.

### Bring it All in

To ensure we have gathered all necessary requirements, towards the end I created a Master board with high level requirements from all users.

We closed out our sessions to gather feedback and prototype the solution to be tested in the next workshop.(Due to NDA, I am not able to display prototypes).

### Conclusion

After the workshop, I started working on prototypes so I can test with the users. This is just a glimpse of the final product after several iterations of testing.
